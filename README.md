# Amazon_Fine_Food_Review_Analysis
This python notebook demonstrate analysis with the Amazon Fine Food Review dataset from Kaggle. The intersection of Natural Language Processing ad Machine Learning Agorithm to understand and analyze dataset well.There is comparison of different Machine Learning Algorithm to check for the best ROC_Score implementing the different models of Bag of Words from NLP. There is comparison based on Unigram model, Bigram Model and TF-IDF Model fitted onn different Machine Learning Algorithms.This dataset is unbalanced dataset , so I have worked on Threshold concept to balance the dataset and measure the performance meterics.


Objective:
For given a text review from Amazon Fine food dataset , determine the text of the review whether its positive or negative sentiment given by users.
